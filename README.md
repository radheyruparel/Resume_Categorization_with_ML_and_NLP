# Resume Categorization with ML and NLP


The "Resume Categorization with ML and DL" project focused on automating the categorization of resumes, streamlining the organization and classification of various resume sections for enhanced efficiency in human resources and recruitment processes.

**Dataset**: A curated dataset was assembled, containing a wide range of resume categories, including HR, Advocate, Designer, Information Technology, Teacher, and more. This diverse dataset served as the foundation for training and evaluating the categorization model.

**Methodology**: The project encompassed several key steps, starting with essential library selection for data analysis. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to gain insights into the dataset. Data preprocessing involved handling missing values and text cleaning to ensure data quality.

**Text Vectorization**: Text data was transformed using the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) technique, facilitating the conversion of textual information into numerical features for machine learning.

**Dataset Splitting**: The dataset was split into training, validation, and testing subsets to enable model training and evaluation.

**Model Training and Evaluation**: Appropriate machine learning and deep learning models were trained based on the prepared data. Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.

**Pickle Files**: Pickle files were generated to store the trained model and TF-IDF data, enabling easy deployment and reuse of the model for resume categorization
